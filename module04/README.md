*<p align="center">Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces</p>*

## Set-up/Compilation:
First, enter any exercise directory with `cd ex<..>`.  
Then use any Makefile command.

#### Makefile Commands:
```C
make        //compile executable (./<exercise name>)
make clean  //delete .o
make fclean //delete .o and executable
make re     //delete .o and executable, then recompile
```

## Overview of exercise objectives:
| # | Objective |
|:---:|:---|
ex00 | Demonstrate `subtype polymorphism` by using a derived class through a base-class pointer. |
ex01 | Implement deep copying in the copy constructor and copy assignment operator. |
ex02 | Create a non-instantiatable abstract class. |
ex03 | Use a pure abstract class as an `interface`. |
