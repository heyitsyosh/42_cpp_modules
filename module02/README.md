*<p align="center">Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form</p>*

## Set-up/Compilation:
First, enter any exercise directory with `cd ex<..>`.  
Then use any Makefile command.

#### Makefile Commands:
```C
make        //compile executable (./<exercise name>)
make clean  //delete .o
make fclean //delete .o and executable
make re     //delete .o and executable, then recompile
```

## Overview of exercise objectives:
| # | Objective |
|:---:|:---|
ex00 | Implement a class in Orthodox Canonical Form (constructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, destructor). Learn the difference between accuracy and precision. |
ex01 | Implement fixed-point number conversion from `int` and `float`. Overload the insertion (`<<`) operator for the class. |
ex02 | Overload arithmetic and increment/decrement operators. *(+, -, /, \*, ++x, --x, x++, x--)* |
ex03 | Use operator overloads to determine whether a point lies inside a triangle defined by three points. |
