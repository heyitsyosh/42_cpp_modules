## Set-up/Compilation:
First, enter any exercise directory with `cd ex<..>`.  
Then use any Makefile command.

#### Makefile Commands:
```C
make        //compile executable (./megaphone, ./phonebook, ./accountant)
make clean  //delete .o
make fclean //delete .o and executable
make re     //delete .o and executable, then recompile
```

## Overview of exercise objectives:
